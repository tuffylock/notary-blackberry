      "As a couple of others have said, check your scanner settings, especially t - reduce the resolution;, scan text not color, don't scan to jpg, etc.By default, your scanner may be set at 300 dpi or higher. The human eye can't really distinguish a difference at anything over 70 dpi. You can test this by simply scanning and printing the same page at whatever your default setting is, and then again at 100 dpi. Compare the two; it's not likely that you'll notice a difference in quality. The difference will be in the size of the file.\n",

      "Gmail can send only a maximum of 25mb as an attachment.  That often isn't enough for large scanned files. So you may have to break the file up and send as separate emails.  Yes, 100 dpi cuts down the file size dramatically, but it distorts the image to the extent that the receiving party may complain that they can't read it.  For that reason, I don't send anything less than 200 dpi. \n",

      "As a couple of others have said, check your scanner settings, especially t - reduce the resolution;, scan text not color, don't scan to jpg, etc.By default, your scanner may be set at 300 dpi or higher. The human eye can't really distinguish a difference at anything over 70 dpi. You can test this by simply scanning and printing the same page at whatever your default setting is, and then again at 100 dpi. Compare the two; it's not likely that you'll notice a difference in quality. The difference will be in the size of the file.\n",

      "Gmail can send only a maximum of 25mb as an attachment.  That often isn't enough for large scanned files. So you may have to break the file up and send as separate emails.  Yes, 100 dpi cuts down the file size dramatically, but it distorts the image to the extent that the receiving party may complain that they can't read it.  For that reason, I don't send anything less than 200 dpi. \n",
